### Instructions to Run:

The user must first start by downloading the required Python packages needed for the program's functionality. 
The user will need to update the Ubuntu platform, 
--sudo apt-get update. 
Also, due to some extra libraries being used, the user will need to have pip3 installed on their device. 
--sudo apt install python3-pip
To be able to use the Tkinker library the user will need to install pillow
--pip3 install pillow
Since a database library is also being used the user will need to install the library for supabase
--pip3 install supabase

The main file for this project is called main.py, and it needs to be ran using python3. In case there are some errors due to missing imports with tkinker additional commands need to be run to install the missing packages.
--sudo apt-get install python3-tk
--sudo apt-get install python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
